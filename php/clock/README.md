# Clock

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

Create a clock that is independent of date.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

## Making the Test Suite Pass

        % chmod +x phpunit.phar

2. Execute the tests for an assignment.

        % phpunit.phar clock_test.php
